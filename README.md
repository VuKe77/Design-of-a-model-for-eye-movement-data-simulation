# Design of a model for eye movement data simulation
This algorithm was developed as a result of my Bachelor Thesis under the mentorship of [Assoc. Prof. Nadica MiljkoviÄ‡](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en/faculty/staff/nadica-miljkovic-4323) from the [University of Belgrade - School of Electrical Engineering](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en) defended on August 27, 2024.
